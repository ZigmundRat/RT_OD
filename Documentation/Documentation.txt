Installation

This document will walk you through setting up this project and configuring the components required
The core operations of this program "Object Recognition" is derived from following the Blog Lessons of Adrian Rosebrock.  

Adrian, his blog, Lessons and related information can be located at https://www.pyimagesearch.com/ Adrian's site is a wealth of information and educational
materials for anyone interested in learning more about Machine learning based Object Recognition.

Components
	1. Real Time Object Detection - Core Module RT_OD.py
		This is the core of this program where all the magic happens
	2. Email Messaging
		This module handles the sending of email alerts if configured
		An Email account is required that supports basic authentication. basic authentication isn't great and is being phased out by many providers
		you milage may vary with this feature.  for example with gmail https://ugtechmag.com/enable-basic-authentication-gmail-account/ even once enabled 
		I find gmail resets this value to off stopping the use of email from this application after a few days. I prefer MMS messaging personally
	3. SMS Messaging
		This module handles the sending of SMS (Text Messages) messages via Twilio if configure. 
		This function reaquires a Paid messaging subscription from Twilio https://www.twilio.com/messaging
		You must generate an API key https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/keys/api-key-resource and https://www.twilio.com/console/project/api-keys
		You must also register a phone number with Twilio to be used to send messages from
	4. MMS Messaging
		This module handles the sending of MMS (Text Messages with attached images) messages via Twilio if configure. 
		This function requires a Paid messaging subscription from Twilio https://www.twilio.com/messaging
		This function also requires a DropBox account in order to upload, store and provide a publicly accessible URL for Twilio to grab the images from
		You must generate an API key https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/keys/api-key-resource and https://www.twilio.com/console/project/api-keys
		You must also register a phone number with Twilio to be used to send messages from
		SMS and MMS use the same Twilio account and information. Registering once will allow both modules to function
		$20 of credit loaded onto Twilio covers my MMS notifications for approx 6-8 weeks. Approx 600 MMS Messages. However this will depend on how many notifications your system generates
	5. DropBox
		This module is used to upload and store detection event images. It is also used to provide publicly accessible URL's for use with Twilio for sending MMS messages
		A Free DropBox account is sufficient https://www.dropbox.com/
		You must generate a dropbox API key for use with this app http://99rabbits.com/get-dropbox-access-token/

Windows Setup
	1. Download and install Anaconda
		Download Link https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows
		Installation Instructions https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ Pretty much leave default and just hit next, next, finish
		Anaconda is a data science tool kit that will allow us to create a virtual envronment on windows machines to run python and linux packages. 
		It is free for personal home use
	2. Create a virtual environment in anaconda from the windows command prompt
		open the command prompt
		issue the following command - "conda create --name opencv-env python=3.7" to create a virtual python environment named opencv-env
	3. Activate the environment from the command prompt with the command "activate opencv-env"
		Note all work needs to be done in the "opencv-env" virtual envronment.  Everytime you want to run or work on the project you must load this envronment
		or your project will not funtion due to missing dependencies
	4. continue and run the linux setup steps from within this virtual environment
